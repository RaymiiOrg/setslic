## Description
Simple shell script to modify a VirtualBox VM to use a ACPI SLIC table, and set custom BIOS/System values.
The intention is to enable VirtualBox to run Windows using the builtin ACPI SLIC and MSDN table - to supply activation information.
This is designed for my own use, and only tested on a Lenovo laptop.

Use this at your own risk !
